each string of letters has an even number of characters.
each string, when split in half, would have one letter that is in both halfs.
depending on it's case and the letter, it can add a different amount of points.

lowercase letters from a-z get points from 1-26 (y would get 24 points)
Uppercase letters from A-Z get points from 27-52 (Y would get 50 points)
