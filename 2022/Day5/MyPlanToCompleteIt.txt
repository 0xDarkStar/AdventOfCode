The input file has both the instructions and the matrix.

I would grab each line and put them into a list.

I would look through the list to find when I see the first numbers (They would be the numbers saying how many columns there are).

Using the number for the final column, I will make that amount of lists in a matrix.

Since I can find the index of the end of the columns, I can then grab the values for each list from the matrix.

After that, I would have it run on a loop:

    Check line:
        line reads "move x from y to z"
        for i in range(x):
            moving = y.pop(-x)
            z.append(moving)
        Instructions from line are complete
    Check next line:
        ...

And repeat.

Since my input only has single digit numbers, I don't have to worry about my instructions being something like:
    "move xx from y to zzz"

I can find each number normally using indexes. But I'd like to be prepared for multi-digit numbers.

To make sure that my script works with multi-digit numbers, I'll be using regular expressions.

The regular expression I'd be using is:
    "move (\d+) from (\d+) to (\d+)"

What this does is search for anything that has:
    - "move "
    - any number of digits
    - " from "
    - any number of digits
    - " to "
    - any number of digits
