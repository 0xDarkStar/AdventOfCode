It would read the input file (a .txt) and make a matrix.
Using the matrix, it would then look at the two items in the sub-list.
By looking, it would be able to:
    - See what the player chose (add those points to a "totalScore" variable)
    - See if the player won that round (add those points the the "totalScore" variable as well)

After looking at all the rounds, it would print the total score for the player.


How would it turn the .txt into a matrix?

It would do that by reading each separate line.
A single line is a round.
It would grab the first and third character and put them into their own little list.
